Ah, access control in Ruby. It's the bane of every developer's existence, am I right? But fear not, dear reader, for I am here to guide you through the treacherous waters of access control in the latest version of Ruby.

First things first, let's define our terms. In Ruby, access control refers to the ability to control what methods or variables can be accessed from outside of a class. This is useful for maintaining the integrity and structure of your code, as well as protecting sensitive information.

So, how do we control access in Ruby? Well, there are three main keywords that we can use: public, protected, and private.

Public methods are just that - public. They can be accessed from anywhere within your code, whether it's inside or outside of the class in which they are defined. Here's an example:

Copy code
class MyClass
  def public_method
    puts "This method is public and can be accessed from anywhere!"
  end
end
Protected methods, on the other hand, can only be accessed from within the class or a subclass. These methods are useful for when you want to allow certain methods to be used by subclass instances, but not by external objects.

Copy code
class MyClass
  protected
  def protected_method
    puts "This method is protected and can only be accessed from within the class or a subclass."
  end
end
Finally, we have private methods. These methods can only be accessed from within the class in which they are defined. They are the most restrictive form of access control in Ruby, and are useful for protecting sensitive information or limiting the way in which certain methods can be used.

Copy code
class MyClass
  private
  def private_method
    puts "This method is private and can only be accessed from within the class."
  end
end
So, there you have it. Access control in Ruby in a nutshell. Just remember to use public, protected, and private wisely, and your code will be secure and organized in no time!
