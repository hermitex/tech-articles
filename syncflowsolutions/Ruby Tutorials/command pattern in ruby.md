Alrighty, so you want to hear about the Command Pattern in Ruby, huh? Well, buckle up because this is going to be a wild ride.

First things first, what the heck is the Command Pattern? In a nutshell, it's a way to encapsulate a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Confused? Yeah, me too. Let's break it down a bit further.

So, imagine you have a bunch of different things you want to do. Maybe you want to turn on a light, maybe you want to open a door, maybe you want to start a car. These are all requests, right? And let's say you have a bunch of different people you want to do these things for you. Maybe you have a light switch, a doorknob, and a car key. These are all the things you use to make your requests happen, right?

Now, let's say you want to add some extra functionality to your requests. Maybe you want to be able to undo your requests, or maybe you want to be able to queue them up and execute them later. This is where the Command Pattern comes in.

With the Command Pattern, you can take all of your requests and wrap them up in little objects called "commands." These commands know how to execute your requests and can also store information about how to undo the request if needed.

So, let's see this in action with some Ruby code.

First, let's create a command for turning on a light.

Copy code
class TurnOnLightCommand
  attr_reader :light

  def initialize(light)
    @light = light
  end

  def execute
    light.on
  end

  def undo
    light.off
  end
end
As you can see, our TurnOnLightCommand knows how to turn on a light and also knows how to turn it off (undo the request). Now, let's create a command for opening a door.

Copy code
class OpenDoorCommand
  attr_reader :door

  def initialize(door)
  @door = door
  end

  def execute
    door.open
  end

  def undo
    door.close
  end
end
Alright, so now we have commands for turning on a light and opening a door. But how do we actually use these commands? That's where a "command invoker" comes in.

Copy code
class CommandInvoker
  attr_reader :commands

  def initialize
    @commands = []
  end

  def add_command(command)
    commands << command
  end

  def execute_commands
    commands.each(&:execute)
  end

  def undo_commands
    commands.reverse_each(&:undo)
  end
end
The CommandInvoker is responsible for storing our commands and executing them when needed. We can add commands to the invoker and then execute them all at once or undo them if needed.

So, let's say we want to turn on a light and open a door. We can do that like this:

Copy code
# Create a light and a door
light = Light.new
door = Door.new

# Create our commands
turn_on_light_command = TurnOnLightCommand.new(light)
open_door_command = OpenDoorCommand

Sure thing! So, we've created our light, door, and commands. Now let's use the CommandInvoker to execute our requests.

Copy code
# Create a CommandInvoker
invoker = CommandInvoker.new

# Add our commands to the invoker
invoker.add_command(turn_on_light_command)
invoker.add_command(open_door_command)

# Execute the commands
invoker.execute_commands

# The light is now on and the door is now open
And voila! Our requests have been executed. But what if we want to undo these requests? No problem, just use the undo_commands method on the invoker.

Copy code
# Undo the commands
invoker.undo_commands

# The light is now off and the door is now closed
And that, my friends, is the Command Pattern in a nutshell. Sure, it might seem a bit complicated at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's a powerful tool to have in your arsenal. Happy coding!
