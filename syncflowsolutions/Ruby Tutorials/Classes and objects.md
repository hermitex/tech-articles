# Classes and objects
Classes and objects are the bread and butter of object-oriented programming in Ruby, so let's dive in and take a closer look.

First of all, let's define a class. A class is like a blueprint or a cookie cutter for creating objects. It defines the characteristics and behavior of the objects it creates. In Ruby, you define a class using the class keyword, followed by the name of the class. Here's an example of a simple class definition:

Copy code
class Dog
  def bark
    puts "Woof!"
  end
end
This class is called Dog, and it has a single method called bark, which just prints out a string. Notice that we use the def keyword to define a method, and we indent the code inside the method using two spaces. This is a common convention in Ruby, and it helps to make the code more readable.

Now, let's create an object from this class. To create an object, or an instance of a class, you use the new method of the class. Here's how you create a new Dog object:

Copy code
fido = Dog.new
This creates a new Dog object and assigns it to a variable called fido. You can think of fido as a specific dog, with its own characteristics and behavior.

To access the behavior of an object, you use the dot operator (.) to call its methods. Here's how you make fido bark:

Copy code
fido.bark
This will print out "Woof!" on the screen.

So that's the basics of classes and objects in Ruby! Of course, there's a lot more to learn about OOP in Ruby, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and more. But I hope this gives you a good starting point and a sense of how classes and objects work in the latest version of Ruby. Happy coding!
