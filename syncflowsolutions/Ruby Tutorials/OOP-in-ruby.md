Here is a list of topics that are commonly covered in an introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) in Ruby:

Classes and objects: understanding the basic concepts of OOP, such as classes, objects, and methods.
Instance variables and methods: learning how to define and use instance variables and methods in Ruby.
Class variables and methods: understanding the difference between instance and class variables and methods, and how to use them in Ruby.
Inheritance: learning how to create a subclass that inherits behavior from a superclass in Ruby.
Polymorphism: understanding how to use polymorphism to allow different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.
Modules: learning about Ruby's module system, and how to use modules to mix in behavior into a class.
Access control: learning about the different levels of access control in Ruby, including public, private, and protected methods.
Exception handling: learning how to use Ruby's exception handling mechanism to handle errors and exceptions in your code.
Duck typing: understanding the concept of duck typing in Ruby, and how it allows for more flexible and dynamic code.
These topics provide a foundation for understanding and using object-oriented programming in Ruby. There are many other topics that can be explored in greater depth, such as metaprogramming, mixins, and more.

Metaprogramming: Metaprogramming is the ability to write code that can modify or generate other code at runtime. Ruby has a number of metaprogramming features, including the ability to define methods and classes dynamically, as well as the ability to introspect and manipulate objects at runtime.

Design patterns: Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. Some popular design patterns in Ruby include the Singleton pattern, the Factory pattern, and the Observer pattern.
