# Class variables and methods
Class variables and methods in Ruby are a great way to keep your code organized and efficient. Let's dive in and see how they work.

First, let's start with class variables. These are variables that are shared among all instances of a class. In other words, they're like global variables, but they're only accessible within the class and its subclasses.

Here's an example of a class variable in action:

Copy code
class Dog
  @@num_legs = 4  # this is a class variable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def self.num_legs
    @@num_legs
  end
end

# Now let's create some dogs and see what happens
dog1 = Dog.new("Rufus")
dog2 = Dog.new("Buddy")

puts Dog.num_legs  # prints 4
puts dog1.num_legs  # also prints 4
puts dog2.num_legs  # you guessed it, 4
As you can see, the class variable @@num_legs is shared by all instances of the Dog class. This is useful if you want to store information that is common to all objects of a certain type.

Now let's talk about class methods. These are methods that are defined at the class level, rather than the instance level. In other words, you can call them directly on the class, rather than on an instance of the class.

Here's an example of a class method:

Copy code
class Cat
  @@num_lives = 9  # class variable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def self.say_meow
    puts "Meow!"
  end
end

# Now let's create a cat and see what happens
fluffy = Cat.new("Fluffy")

Cat.say_meow  # prints "Meow!"
fluffy.say_meow  # this will give an error, because say_meow is a class method
As you can see, the class method say_meow can be called directly on the Cat class, but not on an instance of the Cat class. This is useful for methods that don't need to operate on a specific instance of a class.

I hope this helps clarify class variables and methods in Ruby! As always, happy coding!
