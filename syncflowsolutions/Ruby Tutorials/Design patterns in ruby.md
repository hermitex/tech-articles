In the field of computer science, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

There are several types of design patterns, including creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Structural patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures. Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, what goes on between objects and how they operate together.

In the Ruby programming language, some of the most commonly used design patterns include:

Factory Pattern: This creational pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a super class, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Singleton Pattern: This creational pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.

Observer Pattern: This behavioral pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Command Pattern: This behavioral pattern allows you to encapsulate a request as an object, separating the execution of a request from the actual implementation of the request.

Adapter Pattern: This structural pattern allows you to adapt one interface to another, so that classes can work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

It's important to note that design patterns are not a one-size-fits-all solution and should be used appropriately in the context of your specific problem. It's always a good idea to carefully consider the trade-offs and implications of using a design pattern in your code.
