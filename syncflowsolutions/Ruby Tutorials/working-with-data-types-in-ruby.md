# Data Types in Ruby for Beginners

Data types are the building blocks of any programming language. They are used to store and manipulate data in a program. In Ruby, there are several different data types that can be used to store and manipulate data.

1. Numbers: Numbers are used to represent numerical values in Ruby. There are two types of numbers: integers and floats. Integers are whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, etc. Floats are decimal numbers, such as 1.5, 2.3, etc.

Example:

# Integer

```ruby
x = 10
```

# Float

```ruby
y = 10.5
```

2. Strings: Strings are used to represent text in Ruby. They are enclosed in single or double quotes.

Example:

# String in single quotes

name = 'John'

# String in double quotes

address = "123 Main Street"

3. Arrays: Arrays are used to store a collection of values in Ruby. They are enclosed in square brackets and the values are separated by commas.

Example:

# Array of numbers

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Array of strings

names = ["John", "Jane", "Joe"]

4. Hashes: Hashes are used to store key-value pairs in Ruby. They are enclosed in curly braces and the key-value pairs are separated by commas.

Example:

# Hash of numbers

```ruby
numbers = {1 => "one", 2 => "two"}
```

# Hash of strings

```ruby
names = {"John" => "male", "Jane" => "female"}
```

5. Symbols: Symbols are used to represent names or labels in Ruby. They are preceded by a colon and are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed.

Example:

# Symbol

```ruby
:name
```

# Symbol with value

```ruby
:name => "John"
```

These are the five main data types in Ruby. For more information, please refer to the official Ruby documentation: <https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/doc/syntax/data_types_rdoc.html>
