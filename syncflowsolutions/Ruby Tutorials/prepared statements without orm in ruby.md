Hey there fellow Ruby enthusiasts! Are you tired of using ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping libraries) to execute your SQL statements? Well, have no fear, prepared statements are here!

For those unfamiliar, prepared statements are a way to execute the same SQL statement multiple times with different parameters. This can be especially useful if you're working with large amounts of data or want to increase the efficiency of your database queries.

So, how do we use prepared statements in Ruby without the help of an ORM? First, let's take a look at the code snippet:

Copy code
require 'pg'

# Connect to the database
conn = PG.connect(dbname: 'my_database')

# Prepare the statement
stmt = conn.prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1')

# Execute the statement with different parameters
stmt.exec(1)
stmt.exec(2)
stmt.exec(3)

# Close the prepared statement
stmt.close

# Close the connection
conn.close
As you can see, using prepared statements in Ruby is pretty straightforward. We start by requiring the pg gem, which is a popular library for interacting with PostgreSQL databases in Ruby. Then, we establish a connection to our database using the PG.connect method.

Next, we use the prepare method on our connection object to create a prepared statement. In this case, we're selecting all rows from the users table where the id column is equal to a specified value. Notice that we're using a placeholder ($1) for this value, which we'll later supply when we execute the statement.

Finally, we use the exec method to execute the prepared statement with different parameters (in this case, the values 1, 2, and 3). And when we're done, we close both the prepared statement and the connection to the database.

So there you have it, folks! Prepared statements in Ruby without the need for an ORM. And the best part? No more awkward small talk with your ORM at the dinner table. Happy coding!

can you continue in the same format with more examples
Sure thing! Here are a few more examples of using prepared statements in Ruby:

Inserting data into a table:

Copy code
require 'pg'

# Connect to the database
conn = PG.connect(dbname: 'my_database')

# Prepare the statement
stmt = conn.prepare('INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2)')

# Execute the statement with different parameters
stmt.exec('John Doe', 'john@example.com')
stmt.exec('Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com')

# Close the prepared statement
stmt.close

# Close the connection
conn.close
Updating data in a table:

Copy code
require 'pg'

# Connect to the database
conn = PG.connect(dbname: 'my_database')

# Prepare the statement
stmt = conn.prepare('UPDATE users SET name = $1 WHERE id = $2')

# Execute the statement with different parameters
stmt.exec('John Smith', 1)
stmt.exec('Jane Smith', 2)

# Close the prepared statement
stmt.close

# Close the connection
conn.close
Deleting data from a table:

Copy code
require 'pg'

# Connect to the database
conn = PG.connect(dbname: 'my_database')

# Prepare the statement
stmt = conn.prepare('DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $1')

# Execute the statement with different parameters
stmt.exec(1)
stmt.exec(2)

# Close the prepared statement
stmt.close

# Close the connection
conn.close
And there you have it, folks! Using prepared statements in Ruby without the need for an ORM has never been easier. Happy coding!
