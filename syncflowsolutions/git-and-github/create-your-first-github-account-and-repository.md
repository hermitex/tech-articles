# How to Correctly Create your first Github accout and first repository

Creating a GitHub account is a simple process that only takes a few minutes. Here are the steps to create your first GitHub account:

1. Go to the GitHub website (<https://github.com/>) and click on the “Sign Up” button in the top right corner of the page.

2. Enter your email address, username, and password.

3. Click the “Create an account” button to complete the process.

Once you have created your account, you can start making changes to your repository locally and pushing them to the remote repository on GitHub. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Create a local repository on your computer using the command line. For example, if you are using Git Bash, you can type in the following command:

```bash
git init
```

2. Add the files you want to push to the remote repository. For example, if you want to add all the files in the current directory, you can type in the following command:

```bash
git add .
```

3. Commit your changes with a message. For example, if you want to commit all the changes you have made, you can type in the following command:

```bash
git commit -m "My first commit"
```

4. Add the remote repository URL. For example, if you are using GitHub, you can type in the following command:

```bash
git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
```

5. Push your changes to the remote repository. For example, if you are using GitHub, you can type in the following command:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

Once you have pushed your changes to the remote repository, you can view them on the GitHub website. You can also make changes to the files in the repository and push them back to the remote repository.

For more information about using Git and GitHub, please refer to the official documentation (<https://git-scm.com/doc>) and the GitHub Help page (<https://help.github.com/>).
