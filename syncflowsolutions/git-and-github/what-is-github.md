# What is github and why I need it as a developer

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

GitHub is important because it allows developers to collaborate on projects from anywhere in the world. It also provides a platform for developers to share their code with others and receive feedback. This helps to ensure that code is of high quality and can be used by other developers.

Creating a repository on GitHub is important for developers because it allows them to store their code in a secure place. It also allows them to track changes to their code over time, which can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting. Additionally, it allows developers to collaborate on projects with other developers from around the world.

Other services similar to GitHub include Bitbucket, GitLab, and SourceForge. These services provide similar features as GitHub, such as version control and collaboration tools.
